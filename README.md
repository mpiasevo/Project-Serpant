# Project-Serpant

An adaptation of the original code by PierrMa: https://github.com/PierrMa/Snake-Game-VHDL

The code was modified in order to allow it to work for the Nexys A7 100T board. It was also modified in order to change the obstacles that were on the map, as well as change the colors of the snake, and obstacles. The collision of these obstacles also needed to be edited in order for the snake to function correctly. A variety of colors were added to the segments of the snake in order to make it look more interesting, and a hole at the top and bottom of the map were added in order to make the gameplay a bit different from regular versions of snake, as the snake can now go through this hole and from and come out of the other side.

Some future improvements that could be made to this code could be to add keyboard controls, as well as randomize where the apples appear on the screen.
